✓ **6 Major Rubrics** with 18 sub-categories total:
  1. Research Design (4 sub-rubrics)
  2. Data Analysis (3 sub-rubrics)
  3. Scientific Reasoning (3 sub-rubrics)
  4. Scientific Communication (4 sub-rubrics)
  5. Scientific Ethics and Practice (2 sub-rubrics)
  6. Independent Research Skills (2 sub-rubrics)

✓ **Assessment Tools:**
  - Monthly Skill Checklist
  - Comprehensive Assessment Summary
  - Quick Rubric Card
  - Statistics Checklist
  - Error Analysis Template
  - Argument Evaluation Form

### Chapter 22: Ages 9-10 Teacher Tools
✓ Observation templates (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)
✓ Cross-age skill progression charts (all 6 core skills)
✓ Red Flags and intervention strategies
✓ Quarterly assessment guides with benchmarks
