### Welcome Letter: Science in Our Classroom

*Send at beginning of year*

---

**Dear Families,**

Welcome to our science learning journey! This year, we will nurture your child's natural curiosity through play-based exploration.

**What We Believe About Young Scientists**

Your child is already a scientist! Children at ages 3-4:
- Ask "why" about everything
- Explore with all their senses
- Test how things work
- Form their own theories

Our job is to nurture this natural curiosity, not to teach facts for memorization.

**What Science Looks Like in Our Classroom**

| What You Might See | What We're Learning |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Playing in water | How liquids behave |
| Sorting objects | Classification skills |
| Building with blocks | Engineering and gravity |
| Looking at bugs | Observation skills |
| Mixing colors | Cause and effect |
| Asking endless questions | Curiosity! |

**How We Assess**

We do NOT:
- Give tests or quizzes
- Expect "right" answers
- Compare children to each other

We DO:
- Watch for curiosity and questioning
- Notice how children explore
- Document persistence and problem-solving
- Celebrate wonder and discovery

**How You Can Help at Home**

1. **Answer "why" with "What do you think?"**
2. **Explore nature together**
3. **Let your child get messy**
4. **Celebrate questions more than answers**
5. **Model curiosity yourself**

## 7.5 Differentiation Strategies (Ages 3-4)

### Supporting Children Who Need More Help

**Signs a child may need additional support:**
- Avoids science activities
- Rarely asks questions
- Very limited attention span
- Frustrates easily
- Doesn't engage senses
- Limited verbal description

**Strategies:**

| Challenge | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| **Avoids activities** | Start with high-interest topics; reduce novelty; use peer partners |
| **Doesn't ask questions** | Model wondering aloud; prompt with choices; celebrate ANY question |
| **Short attention** | Break into smaller parts; add movement; use high-interest materials |
| **Frustrates easily** | Ensure early success; break tasks down; give immediate feedback |
| **Avoids sensory** | Introduce gradually; offer choices; respect limits |
| **Limited language** | Use visual supports; accept non-verbal communication; model vocabulary |

**Scaffolding Examples:**

| Standard Approach | Scaffolded Approach |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "What do you think will happen?" | "Will it sink or float?" (binary choice) |
| "What do you notice?" | "Is it hard or soft?" (specific prompt) |
| "Tell me about your experiment." | "Show me what you did." (non-verbal option) |

---

### Challenging Children Who Need Extension

**Signs a child is ready for more challenge:**
- Asks complex questions
- Extended attention on science
- Makes connections across topics
- Wants to teach peers
- Extends beyond planned activity
- Designs own experiments

**Strategies:**

| Strength | Extension |
|----------|-----------|
| **Complex questions** | Research answers together; connect to real science |
| **Extended attention** | Longer projects; deeper investigation |
| **Makes connections** | Encourage cross-topic thinking; create idea webs |
| **Teaches peers** | Leadership roles; peer mentoring opportunities |
| **Wants more** | Take-home extensions; choice of direction |
| **Designs experiments** | Support implementation; help document |

**Extension Examples:**

| Standard Approach | Extended Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "What do you think will happen?" | "What do you think will happen, and what makes you think that?" |
| "What do you notice?" | "What details do you notice that others might miss?" |
| "Tell me what you learned." | "Can you teach someone else what you discovered?" |

---

# VOLUME 3: AGES 5-6 (EXPLORER STAGE)

---

# Chapter 8: Ages 5-6 Overview

## 8.1 The Explorer Stage Philosophy

At ages 5-6, children are transitioning from parallel play to collaborative exploration. They can follow multi-step procedures, make predictions, and begin to record observations with support. This is a time of growing independence and more systematic thinking.

### Key Shifts from Ages 3-4

| Ages 3-4 | Ages 5-6 |
|----------|----------|
| Exploration over explanation | Prediction before testing |
| Sensory exploration | Systematic observation |
| Verbal sharing | Simple recording (drawing, dictating) |
| Adult-guided activities | Growing independence |
| "What happens?" | "What do you think will happen? Why?" |

### Our Role at This Stage

| We DO | We DON'T |
|-------|----------|
| Ask for predictions before testing | Accept "I don't know" without gentle follow-up |
| Encourage simple recording | Expect written reports |
| Support growing independence | Leave children without scaffolding |
| Introduce simple vocabulary | Lecture or over-explain |
| Help compare predictions to results | Emphasize "right" and "wrong" |

---

## 8.2 Developmental Context (Ages 5-6)

### Cognitive Development

| Area | Typical Development | Implication for Science |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Attention** | 15-25 minutes for engaging activities | Can complete longer experiments |
| **Memory** | Improving; can recall steps | Can follow multi-step procedures |
| **Reasoning** | Transitioning to concrete logic | Can make simple logical connections |
| **Language** | Complex sentences; 5-8 words | Can describe observations in detail |
| **Causality** | Understands simple cause-effect | Can predict outcomes based on experience |

### Social-Emotional Development

| Area | Typical Development | Implication for Science |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Cooperation** | Can work with partners | Collaborative experiments possible |
| **Independence** | Wants to do things "all by myself" | Allow more autonomy; less hand-holding |
| **Frustration tolerance** | Improving; can persist longer | Can handle experiments that don't work first time |
| **Communication** | Enjoys sharing; can explain | Can present findings to others |

### Physical Development

| Area | Typical Development | Implication for Science |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Fine motor** | Much improved; can use tools | Can use scissors, droppers, rulers |
| **Writing** | Emerging; can draw and label | Can record with drawing and simple words |
| **Gross motor** | Well-coordinated | Active outdoor science works well |

---

## 8.3 Learning Dispositions Focus (Ages 5-6)

Building on Te Whāriki framework:

| Disposition | What It Looks Like at 5-6 | How to Nurture |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Curiosity** | Asks "why" and "how" questions; interested in new things; wonders about processes | Encourage questions; help find answers; follow interests |
| **Courage** | Willing to try new things; makes predictions even when unsure; takes intellectual risks | Value all attempts; normalize "wrong" predictions |
| **Trust** | Believes they can figure things out; asks for help appropriately | Provide success experiences; scaffold appropriately |
| **Perseverance** | Continues when things are hard; tries different approaches | Acknowledge effort; provide strategies |
| **Confidence** | Shares ideas with others; proud of discoveries; explains thinking | Provide audience; display work; celebrate sharing |

---

## 8.4 Key Scientific Skills for Ages 5-6

### Primary Focus Skills

| Skill | What It Means at This Age | What to Look For |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Predicting** | Guessing what will happen BEFORE testing | "I think... because..." before experiments |
| **Observing** | Detailed observation using multiple senses | Noticing details; describing precisely |
| **Recording** | Simple documentation of observations | Drawing what they see; dictating descriptions |
| **Comparing** | Checking predictions against results | "I thought... but actually..." |
| **Explaining** | Describing what happened and why | Sequence of events; simple cause-effect |

### Emerging Skills (Introduce but don't require mastery)

| Skill | What It Means | Simple Introduction |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Fair testing** | Keeping things the same except what you're testing | "We should use the same amount of water each time" |
| **Measuring** | Using tools to quantify | Rulers, cups, counting |
| **Simple graphing** | Visual representation of data | Picture graphs, object graphs |

---

## 8.5 Science Vocabulary Focus (Ages 5-6)

# Chapter 9: Ages 5-6 Weekly Experiments

## Structure for Each Experiment

Each experiment at this age includes:
- **Question:** What we're exploring
- **Materials:** What you need
- **Time:** Expected duration
- **Method:** Step-by-step (with predictions)
- **Record It:** How to document
- **Talk About:** Discussion questions
- **Khasi Connection:** Local relevance
- **Take It Further:** Extensions

---

## Quarter 1: Measuring and Comparing (Weeks 1-13)

---

### Week 1: How Long Is Everything?

**Question:** How can we measure things without a ruler?

**Materials:**
- String
- Your hands
- Your feet
- Pencil or craft sticks
- Objects to measure (table, book, door, yourself)

**Time:** 25 minutes

**Predict First:**
"How many hand-widths wide do you think the table is?"

**Method:**
1. Choose something to measure (table)
2. Predict how many hand-widths it will be
3. Measure using your hands—count how many
4. Record prediction and actual measurement
5. Measure the same thing with string
6. Compare your string to a friend's or family member's measurement
7. Discuss: Are they the same?

**Record It:**
| Object | My Prediction | Actual (hands) | String Length |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Table | | | |
| Book | | | |
| Door | | | |

**Talk About:**
- "Why might your answer be different from mine?" (Different hand sizes!)
- "Why do we need standard rulers?"
- "What would happen if everyone measured with their own hands?"

**Khasi Connection:**
"Traditional measurements used body parts—hands, arms, feet. Ask elders what Khasi words are used for these measurements. Why might standard measurements be important for building?"

**Take It Further:**
- Create your own "measurement stick" and use it consistently
- Measure the same object with different body parts
- Compare measurements with a real ruler

---

### Week 2: How Heavy Is Heavy?

**Question:** How can we compare weights without a scale?

**Materials:**
- Simple balance (ruler on pencil point, or wire hanger with cups)
- Various objects to compare
- Small containers or bags
- String

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Predict First:**
"Which is heavier—this apple or this orange?"

**Method:**
1. Build a simple balance:
   - Balance ruler on pencil point, OR
   - Hang two cups from a hanger with string
2. Choose two objects to compare
3. Predict which is heavier
4. Test using your balance
5. Were you right?
6. Try to find things that balance perfectly (equal weight)
7. Put objects in order from lightest to heaviest

**Record It:**

| Object 1 | Object 2 | Prediction (which heavier?) | Result | ✓ or ✗ |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|--------|--------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Talk About:**
- "Can big things be lighter than small things? Give an example."
- "How do we measure weight exactly?"
- "Why does the balance tip?"

**Khasi Connection:**
"Traditional markets used balance scales to weigh goods. Some still do! Visit Bara Bazaar and watch how vendors use scales."

**Take It Further:**
- Estimate weights before testing
- Find things around the house that are surprisingly heavy or light
- Research how modern scales work

---

### Week 3: Temperature Tracking

**Question:** How does temperature change during the day?

**Materials:**
- Thermometer (or weather app on phone)
- Notebook
- Colored pencils for graphing

**Time:** 5 minutes, 4 times per day, for one week

**Predict First:**
"When do you think it's warmest during the day? Coldest?"

**Method:**
1. Measure temperature at the same times each day:
   - Morning (wake up)
   - Midday (noon)
   - Afternoon (3-4 PM)
   - Evening (bedtime)
2. Record each measurement
3. After one week, look at your data
4. Create a simple bar graph

**Record It:**

**Day 1:**
| Time | Prediction | Actual Temperature |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Morning | | |
| Midday | | |
| Afternoon | | |
| Evening | | |

(Repeat for 7 days)

**Talk About:**
- "When was it warmest each day? Coldest?"
- "Was your prediction right?"
- "Why is it warmer in the afternoon than morning?"

**Khasi Connection:**
"Shillong has cooler temperatures than most of India. Why do you think that is? How might living in the hills affect temperature?"

**Take It Further:**
- Compare indoor vs. outdoor temperature
- Compare temperature in sun vs. shade
- Research why Meghalaya is cooler than the plains

---

### Week 4: Counting in Nature

**Question:** How many living things are in one small space?

**Materials:**
- String or sticks (to mark a 1m × 1m square)
- Notebook
- Magnifying glass (if available)
- Pencil

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Predict First:**
"How many different living things do you think are in this small area?"

**Method:**
1. Go outside to a natural area (garden, field, forest edge)
2. Mark a square (1 meter × 1 meter) using string or sticks
3. Predict how many different living things you'll find
4. Look carefully and count:
   - Different plant types
   - Insects and bugs
   - Other animals
   - Fungi
5. Compare to another square in a different location

**Record It:**

| Category | Square 1 (Location: ____) | Square 2 (Location: ____) |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Plant types | | |
| Insects | | |
| Other animals | | |
| Fungi | | |
| Other | | |
| **TOTAL** | | |

**Talk About:**
- "Were there more things than you expected?"
- "Why might different places have different numbers?"
- "What's the smallest living thing you found?"

**Khasi Connection:**
"Meghalaya is a biodiversity hotspot—even small spaces have many species. Scientists from around the world come here to study our plants and animals. Why do we have so much diversity?"

**Take It Further:**
- Count same square in different seasons
- Compare a garden to a forest
- Compare wet areas to dry areas

---

### Week 5: Water Measurement

**Question:** How much water do we use?

**Materials:**
- Measuring cups and containers
- Notebook
- Bucket (for catching water)

**Time:** Full day observation

**Predict First:**
"How many cups of water do you think you use for brushing teeth?"

**Method:**
1. Measure water used for different activities:
   - One glass of drinking water
   - Brushing teeth (catch water in bucket, measure)
   - Washing hands (estimate or catch)
   - Washing face
   - Bathing (estimate)
2. Record each amount
3. Add up total water for the day

**Record It:**

| Activity | Prediction | Actual Amount |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Drinking (1 glass) | | |
| Brushing teeth | | |
| Washing hands (each time) | | |
| Washing face | | |
| Bathing | | |
| Other: | | |
| **TOTAL FOR DAY** | | |

**Talk About:**
- "What uses the most water?"

| Challenge | Strategy | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Can't predict** | Offer binary choices | "Will it sink or float?" |
| **Doesn't record** | Adult scribes; use stamps | "I'll write what you say" |
| **Short attention** | Break into short segments | 5 min predict, 5 min test, 5 min discuss |
| **Doesn't compare** | Use visual reminders | Photo of prediction next to result |
| **Limited vocabulary** | Use picture supports | Vocabulary cards with images |

### Extending Advanced Learners

| Strength | Extension | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Makes detailed predictions** | Ask for multiple predictions | "What's another thing that might happen?" |
| **Records well** | Create original recording methods | "How could you show this differently?" |
| **Long attention** | Multi-day investigations | Week-long projects |
| **Explains clearly** | Present to others | Teach younger children |
| **Strong vocabulary** | Introduce technical terms | Use "hypothesis" instead of "prediction" |
