- **Dependent variable:** The thing we measure (the result)
- **Controlled variables:** Everything we keep the SAME

**Materials:**
- Paper (to make identical airplanes)
- Measuring tape
- Stopwatch
- Notebook

**Method:**

**Activity 1: The Unfair Test**
1. Person A makes a paper airplane and throws it from standing height
2. Person B makes a DIFFERENT paper airplane and throws from kneeling height
3. Measure both distances
4. Discuss: Can we say which airplane design is better?
5. Answer: NO! The test was unfair because we changed TWO things

**Activity 2: The Fair Test**
1. Both people make IDENTICAL airplanes
2. Both throw from SAME height
3. Both use SAME throwing motion
4. Measure distances
5. Discuss: NOW can we compare? What did we keep the same?

**Data Collection:**

| Test | Airplane Design | Throw Height | Thrower | Distance | Fair Test? |
|------|-----------------|--------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Unfair 1 | Design A | Standing | Person A | | No |
| Unfair 2 | Design B | Kneeling | Person B | | No |
| Fair 1 | Design A | Standing | Person A | | Yes |
| Fair 2 | Design A | Standing | Person B | | Yes |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. "What made the first test unfair?"
2. "What variables did we control in the fair test?"
3. "Why does it matter if a test is fair?"

**Conclusion Guide:**
Write in your notebook:
- Today I learned that a fair test means _______________
- The variables we kept the same were _______________
- Fair tests are important because _______________

**Khasi Connection:**
"When scientists compare sacred groves to regular forests in Meghalaya, they must compare similar-sized areas with similar conditions. That's fair testing in real science!"

- Previous experiments for reference

**Method:**

**Part 1: Hypothesis Analysis**
Rate these hypotheses: Weak (W), Medium (M), or Strong (S)

1. "I think it will float." _____
2. "If I add salt to water, then ice will melt faster." _____
3. "If I add salt to water, then ice will melt faster, because salt lowers the freezing point of water." _____
4. "The blue light will make plants grow more." _____
5. "If plants receive blue light, then they will grow taller than plants in green light, because blue light is used more in photosynthesis." _____

**Answers:** 1-W, 2-M, 3-S, 4-W, 5-S

| 🌔 **Proficient** | Clear, testable, specific questions | "How does the amount of water affect plant growth?" |
| 🌕 **Advanced** | Refined questions with consideration of variables | "How does the amount of water (50ml vs. 100ml daily) affect the height growth of bean plants over 3 weeks?" |

### 1B: Hypothesis Writing

| Level | Indicators | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 🌒 **Emerging** | Simple guess without reasoning | "I think it will grow." |
| 🌓 **Developing** | Prediction with basic reasoning | "I think more water will help plants grow because plants need water." |
| 🌔 **Proficient** | If-then-because format with clear reasoning | "If I give plants more water, then they will grow taller, because water is needed for photosynthesis." |
| 🌕 **Advanced** | Specific, testable hypothesis with scientific reasoning | "If I water bean plants with 100ml instead of 50ml daily, then they will grow at least 20% taller after 3 weeks, because additional water supports increased cell expansion and nutrient transport." |
