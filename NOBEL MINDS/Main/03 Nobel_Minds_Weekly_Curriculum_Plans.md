## Final Notes on Curriculum

### Principles That Apply to All Ages

1. **Curiosity over coverage:** Better to go deep on one topic than shallow on many
2. **Questions over answers:** The goal is better questions, not just correct answers
3. **Failure as learning:** Every curriculum should explicitly include failure reflection
4. **Self-direction increases with age:** Gradually shift from parent-led to child-led
5. **Flexibility is essential:** Follow the child's interest, not the schedule rigidly

### How to Adapt

- If child is bored: Increase difficulty, give more independence
- If child is struggling: Slow down, provide more support, make it more playful
- If child loses interest: Find the connection to their existing interests
- If schedule feels like burden: Reduce structure, focus on wonder

### The Ultimate Goal

By age 18, your child should be able to:
- Ask original questions
- Design ways to answer them
- Persist through failure
- Communicate findings
- Connect knowledge across fields
- Think ethically about implications

**That's what creates a Nobel mind—not any specific curriculum.**
