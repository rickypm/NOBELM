## Final Message

### You Have Everything You Need

The wettest place on Earth. Living bridges that grow. Caves that stretch for kilometers. Sacred forests that your ancestors protected. Rainfall your great-grandparents have watched for generations.

**You don't need expensive equipment.**
**You don't need to leave Meghalaya.**
**You already live in one of the world's greatest natural laboratories.**

The questions are all around you:
- Why here? (Why is this place so unique?)
- How does it work? (What can we learn from it?)
- What's changing? (How can we protect it?)
- What don't we know yet? (What can you discover?)

### The Khasi Scientist's Advantage

You understand this land. You speak the languages of the people who have observed it for generations. You have access to traditional knowledge that scientists from Delhi or America will never have.

**Combine your knowledge with scientific tools.**
**Ask questions that no one else is asking.**
**That's how Nobel minds work.**
