## Research-Based Assessment Principles

### From the Research, We Know:

| Research Finding | Nobel Minds Application |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Observation > Testing** (HighScope research) | No tests; observation-only assessment |
| **Process > Product** (Reggio research) | Assess HOW children think, not just WHAT they know |
| **Narrative captures complexity** (Te Whāriki) | Learning stories alongside rubrics |
| **Dispositions predict success** (multiple studies) | Focus on curiosity, persistence, etc. |
| **Family involvement matters** (all frameworks) | Parents as assessment partners |
| **Cultural responsiveness essential** (Te Whāriki, Anji) | Khasi knowledge integration |
| **Play is learning** (all frameworks) | Assessment during play, not separate |

| **Cognitive** | Pre-operational to concrete operational transition | Accept magical thinking alongside emerging logic |
| **Language** | Rapid vocabulary expansion; 5-8 word sentences | Model scientific vocabulary in context |
| **Social** | Cooperative play emerging; interest in peers | Include collaborative science |
| **Physical** | Fine motor improving; can use tools | Provide appropriate science tools |
| **Attention** | 15-25 minutes for engaging activities | Allow time for deep exploration |

### Learning Dispositions Focus (Te Whāriki-Inspired)

| Disposition | What It Looks Like at 5-6 |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Curiosity** | Asks "why" and "how" questions; interested in new things |
| **Courage** | Willing to try; makes predictions even if unsure |
| **Trust** | Believes they can learn; asks for help appropriately |
| **Perseverance** | Continues when things are hard; tries again |
| **Confidence** | Shares ideas; shows work to others |

# Nobel Failures: Stories to Share

## Why Share Failure Stories?

- **Normalizes struggle** — Even the greatest scientists failed
- **Shows persistence matters** — Most succeeded after many failures
- **Removes perfectionism** — It's okay not to get it right
- **Inspires resilience** — Keep trying!
- **Humanizes scientists** — They're people, not geniuses on pedestals

---

## Failure Stories by Age Appropriateness

### For Ages 3-6: Simple Stories

#### Thomas Edison and the Light Bulb

**The Story:**
Thomas Edison tried to make a light bulb that would work for a long time. He tried over 1,000 different materials before finding one that worked!

**The Quote:**
"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

**The Lesson:**
Every "failure" taught him something. He didn't give up—he kept learning.

**Discussion:**
- "How would you feel if something didn't work 1,000 times?"
- "What did Edison learn from things that didn't work?"

---

#### The Wright Brothers' Crashes

**The Story:**
Before Wilbur and Orville Wright flew their airplane, they crashed many, many times. They broke their flying machines again and again. Each crash taught them something about how to fly better.

**The Quote:**
"If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true, then there would be little hope for advance."

**The Lesson:**
Crashing was part of learning. They studied each crash to understand what went wrong.

**Discussion:**
- "Have you ever had to try something many times before it worked?"
- "What did you learn from the times it didn't work?"

---

### For Ages 7-8: More Detailed Stories

#### Albert Einstein's "Failures"

**The Story:**
Albert Einstein, one of the most famous scientists ever:
- Failed his first university entrance exam
- Couldn't get a teaching job after graduation
- Worked as a patent clerk while doing science as a hobby
- His teachers said he wouldn't amount to much

He developed his theory of relativity while working at that "boring" job, with no fancy lab or prestigious position.

**The Quote:**
"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."

**The Lesson:**
School success and life success are different things. Keep working on what interests you, even if no one else believes in you yet.

**Discussion:**
- "Have you ever been told you couldn't do something?"
- "What would happen if Einstein had believed his teachers?"

---

#### Barbara McClintock: Ignored for 30 Years

**The Story:**
Barbara McClintock discovered "jumping genes"—genes that move around in DNA. Other scientists thought she was wrong. For 30 years, people ignored her work and called it crazy.

She kept working anyway. Finally, when other scientists found the same thing, she was recognized. She won the Nobel Prize at age 81—30 years after her discovery!

**The Quote:**
"If you know you're right, eventually it will come out."

**The Lesson:**
Sometimes you're right even when everyone else says you're wrong. Have the courage to trust your evidence.

**Discussion:**
- "Would you keep working on something if everyone said you were wrong?"
- "How did Barbara know she was right?"

---

### For Ages 9-10: Complex Stories

#### Tu Youyou: No PhD, No Foreign Training, Nobel Prize

**The Story:**
Tu Youyou is a Chinese scientist who won the Nobel Prize for discovering a malaria treatment. She is remarkable because:
- She never earned a PhD
- She never studied abroad
- She never had a fancy position
- She was almost unknown outside China

During China's Cultural Revolution, when science was suppressed, she searched through ancient Chinese medicine books. She found a 1,600-year-old recipe using sweet wormwood. After many failed attempts to extract the medicine correctly, she finally found a method that worked—by going back to the ancient text and noticing it said to use cold water, not hot.

Her treatment has saved millions of lives.

**The Quote:**
"Every scientist dreams of doing something that can help the world."

**The Lesson:**
You don't need fancy credentials to make discoveries. Traditional knowledge and careful reading of old texts led to a Nobel Prize. The "failures" of others were her starting point.

**Discussion:**
- "Tu Youyou used traditional Chinese medicine. What traditional Khasi knowledge might help solve problems?"
- "Why do you think she looked at 1,600-year-old books?"

---

#### Venkatraman Ramakrishnan: "Unremarkable" to Nobel

**The Story:**
Venki Ramakrishnan is an Indian-born scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He wrote:
- "I was not particularly remarkable as a student"
- He switched fields multiple times
- He was rejected for many jobs
- He was almost unknown until his Nobel Prize

His Nobel Prize work was solving the structure of the ribosome—something that helps cells make proteins. It took years of work with no guarantee of success.

**The Quote:**
"I think we overemphasize the past achievements of scientists and undervalue the importance of steady, hard work."

**The Lesson:**
You
