# Nobel Failures: Stories to Share (Continued)

## For Ages 9-10: Complex Stories (Continued)

### Venkatraman Ramakrishnan: "Unremarkable" to Nobel (Complete Story)

**The Story:**
Venki Ramakrishnan is an Indian-born scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009. His journey was anything but smooth:

- **"I was not particularly remarkable as a student"** — His own words
- Started studying physics, then switched to biology at age 28
- Was rejected for many jobs and grants
- Worked in relative obscurity for years
- Almost unknown until his Nobel Prize announcement
- Even his mother didn't understand what he did!

His Nobel Prize work was solving the structure of the ribosome—the cellular machine that makes proteins. It took years of painstaking work, using a technique called X-ray crystallography, with no guarantee of success. Many scientists had tried and failed before him.

When he won the Nobel Prize, he famously bicycled to work the next day as usual.

**The Quote:**
"I think we overemphasize the past achievements of scientists and undervalue the importance of steady, hard work over many years."

**The Lesson:**
You don't need to be a child prodigy or a "genius" to do Nobel-level work. What you need is:
- Willingness to change direction when needed
- Persistence over many years
- Focus on the work, not the recognition

**Indian Connection:**
Venki grew up in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu. He shows that world-changing scientists can come from anywhere in India—including places like Meghalaya!

**Discussion:**
- "Venki switched fields at 28. What does this tell you about when you need to 'figure out your life'?"
- "Why do you think he still rode his bicycle to work after winning?"
- "What would you keep doing even if you became famous?"

### WD-40: 40 Failures, Then Success

**The Story:**
WD-40 is a spray that millions of people use to fix squeaky hinges and protect metal. But do you know what the name means?

**WD-40 = Water Displacement, 40th Formula**

A chemist named Norm Larsen tried to create a formula to prevent rust on missiles. His first 39 attempts failed. Each time, he wrote down what went wrong and tried again.

Formula 40 worked perfectly. Instead of hiding the failures, the company named the product after them!

**The Quote:**
"WD-40 literally tells you it took them 40 tries. Don't give up on try 3!"

**The Lesson:**
Some of the most successful products in the world are named after their failures. The 39 "failed" formulas weren't failures—they were necessary steps to success.

**Discussion:**
- "Would you have kept trying after 39 failures?"
- "Why do you think they named it WD-40 instead of hiding the failures?"
- "What would you name your invention if it took 20 tries?"

### Kalpana Chawla: From Karnal to Space

**The Story:**
Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian-born woman in space. But her path was full of obstacles:

- Born in a small town (Karnal, Haryana) where girls were often not encouraged to dream big
- Her father initially didn't support her ambitions
- She was told aerospace engineering was "not for girls"
- She faced discrimination in the US as an immigrant woman
- She was rejected by NASA multiple times before being accepted

She didn't let any of this stop her. She earned her PhD and became an astronaut. On her first mission in 1997, she spent 372 hours in space.

Tragically, she died in the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003. But her legacy lives on as an inspiration to millions of girls who are told they can't achieve their dreams.

**The Quote:**
"The path from dreams to success does exist. May you have the vision to find it, the courage to get on to it, and the perseverance to follow it."

**The Lesson:**
When people tell you "that's not for people like you," they are often wrong. Kalpana faced rejection because of where she came from and because she was a woman. She proved that determination matters more than what others expect of you.

**Meghalaya Connection:**
Khasi society is matrilineal, with women holding important roles. What scientific dreams do Khasi girls have? What barriers might they face, and how can they overcome them like Kalpana did?

**Discussion:**
- "Has anyone ever told you that you couldn't do something because of who you are?"
- "What would Kalpana say to a girl in Meghalaya who wants to be a scientist?"
- "What barriers exist today that might not exist when you're an adult?"

### Jagadish Chandra Bose: Ignored, Then Vindicated

**The Story:**
J.C. Bose was a Bengali scientist in the late 1800s. He made groundbreaking discoveries, but faced enormous obstacles:

**His Failures and Struggles:**
- British colonial rulers paid Indian professors 1/3 of what British professors earned
- He refused the lower salary for three years (working without pay!) until they gave him equal wages
- He invented radio technology but didn't patent it; Marconi got the credit
- He discovered that plants respond to stimuli (they "feel" things), but Western scientists laughed at him
- He was denied resources and recognition because he was Indian

**His Vindication:**
- Today, he is recognized as one of the fathers of radio science
- His plant research was proven correct decades later
- A crater on the moon is named after him
- He founded the Bose Institute in Kolkata

**The Quote:**
"I have no desire to establish priority. The spirit of our national culture demands that we should forever be seekers and never claim that we have found."

**The Lesson:**
J.C. Bose faced discrimination because of colonialism and racism. He didn't give up, and he didn't compromise his principles. He chose to share his knowledge freely rather than patent it. History eventually recognized his contributions.

**Northeast India Connection:**
Like J.C. Bose, scientists from Northeast India might face discrimination or lack of recognition. His story shows that doing good science matters more than getting immediate credit.

**Discussion:**
- "Why do you think Western scientists laughed at Bose's plant research?"
- "Was Bose wrong not to patent his radio invention? What would you have done?"
- "What traditional knowledge from Meghalaya might be laughed at by outsiders but later proven correct?"

### Percy Spencer: Accidental Microwave Discovery

**The Story:**
Percy Spencer never finished elementary school. He was an orphan who taught himself engineering by reading books.

One day in 1945, he was working near a radar machine when he noticed the chocolate bar in his pocket had melted. Instead of just getting annoyed, he asked: "Why did that happen?"

He experimented with popcorn kernels near the radar. They popped! He tried an egg—it exploded! (Failure, but informative!)

From this accident came the microwave oven, now in kitchens worldwide.

**The Quote:**
"There is no such thing as a failed experiment, only experiments with unexpected outcomes." (Not Spencer's quote, but relevant)

**The Lesson:**
- You don't need fancy degrees to make discoveries
- Pay attention to accidents and anomalies
- Ask "why?" when something unexpected happens
- A melted chocolate bar changed the world

**Discussion:**
- "What 'accidents' have you noticed? Did you ask why they happened?"
- "Percy had no formal education but curiosity and observation skills. Which matters more?"
- "What unexpected thing have you seen recently that made you wonder?"

| Child's experiment "fails" | Edison, WD-40 | Normalize failure as learning |
| Child feels "not smart enough" | Einstein, Venki | Intelligence isn't fixed |
| Child faces discrimination | Bose, Kalpana | Barriers can be overcome |
| Child has accident/unexpected result | Percy Spencer | Accidents can lead to discovery |
| Child wants to give up | All of them | Everyone successful failed first |

### Discussion Framework

After any failure story, ask:
1. **What went wrong?** (Understand the failure)
2. **What did they learn?** (Extract the lesson)
3. **What did they do next?** (Action after failure)
4. **How does this connect to you?** (Personal relevance)
5. **What would you do?** (Application)

# Closing Statement

## The Heart of Nobel Minds Assessment

Assessment in Nobel Minds is not about measuring children against a standard. It's about:

**Seeing each child** — Truly observing who they are as thinkers

**Nurturing growth** — Using what we see to help them flourish

**Celebrating journey** — Honoring the path, not just the destination

**Building partnership** — Working with families as allies

**Honoring culture** — Integrating Khasi knowledge and values

**Developing scientists** — Not people who know facts, but people who THINK

---

## A Final Word

Every child who looks at a raindrop and wonders where it came from...

Every child who asks "why" when adults have stopped asking...

Every child who tries again after something doesn't work...

Every child who shares a discovery with excitement...

**That child is already a scientist.**

Our job is not to create scientists. Our job is to protect and nurture the scientists that children already are.

**The assessment tools in this guide help us see and celebrate the scientist in every child.**

---

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire."*
— W.B. Yeats

*"Ka jingiasnoh ia ka ri ia ka hima"*
(Love for land and people)
— Khasi wisdom

---

**The Nobel Mind is already in your child. Help it grow.**
