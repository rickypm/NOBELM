---

### 6. Competency-Based Education

**NEP 2020 States:** "The curriculum will be reduced in each subject to its core essentials... to make space for critical thinking and more holistic, inquiry-based, discovery-based, discussion-based, and analysis-based learning."

**Nobel Minds Competency Focus:**

| Stage | Core Competencies Developed |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Ages 3-4 | Curiosity, observation, questioning, sensory exploration |
| Ages 5-6 | Prediction, recording, comparison, communication |
| Ages 7-8 | Hypothesis formation, variable control, data analysis, conclusion |
| Ages 9-10 | Research design, statistical thinking, peer review, scientific writing |

---

### 7. Formative Assessment

**NEP 2020 States:** "The aim of assessment will be primarily to help the teacher and student... Assessment should be used primarily as a developmental tool."

**Nobel Minds Assessment Alignment:**

| NEP Principle | Nobel Minds Practice |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Formative over summative | Ongoing observation, not tests |
| Developmental purpose | Assessment guides teaching |
| Multiple methods | Observation, portfolios, conversations |

## Welcome Letter (Full Text)

**NOBEL MINDS SCIENCE PROGRAM**
**Welcome Letter to Families**

---

Dear Family,

Welcome to Nobel Minds! Your child is learning to think like a scientist.

**What does this mean?**

Scientists are curious. They ask questions like "Why?" and "What if?" They try things to find answers. Sometimes they're wrong, but they learn from mistakes and try again. Then they share what they discovered.

Your child is learning to do all of this!

**What will your child do?**

- Ask lots of questions
- Make guesses (predictions)
- Do experiments to test their guesses
- Look carefully and record what happens
- Think about what they learned
- Share their discoveries

**How can you help?**

You don't need to be a science expert! You just need to:

1. **Be curious together** - Say "I wonder..." about everyday things
2. **Ask questions** - "What do you think will happen?" "Why do you think that?"
3. **Let them try** - Even if they might make mistakes
4. **Celebrate effort** - "Good try! What did you learn?"
5. **Listen** - Your child has interesting ideas!

**Science is everywhere at home:**

- **Cooking** is chemistry! Ask about changes you see.
- **Gardening** is biology! Watch things grow.
- **Weather** is meteorology! Observe and predict.
- **Building** is engineering! Design and test.
- **Bugs and animals** are zoology! Observe carefully.

**What will you receive from us?**

- Weekly activity suggestions
- Monthly observation forms
- Quarterly progress reports
- Invitations to family science events

**What do we need from you?**

- Share what you notice at home
- Complete the simple observation form when you can
- Come to family conferences
- Ask us questions anytime!

**Remember:** You don't need special equipment or knowledge. You just need curiosity and time to wonder together.

Welcome to our science family!

## FAQ Sheet for Parents

**Frequently Asked Questions about Nobel Minds**

**Q: Do I need to know science to help my child?**
A: No! You just need to be curious together. When your child asks a question you don't know, say "Great question! Let's find out together!" That's exactly what scientists do.

**Q: What if my child gets the "wrong" answer?**
A: In Nobel Minds, there are no wrong answers—only learning opportunities. If your child's prediction doesn't match what happens, ask "What did you learn?" That's how real scientists work too.

**Q: How much time does this take?**
A: Just 5-10 minutes a day is enough! Ask one "why" question during dinner. Notice one thing on a walk. That's science!

**Q: My child doesn't like science. What should I do?**
A: Maybe they haven't found their science interest yet. Try different topics—cooking, animals, weather, building. Everyone is curious about something!

**Q: Should I correct my child's "wrong" ideas about science?**
A: Not directly. Instead, help them test their ideas. If they think heavy things sink, try different objects together. Let them discover the truth through experience.

**Q: What if we don't have science equipment?**
A: You don't need any! Science uses everyday items: water, kitchen stuff, things from nature. The most important tool is curiosity.

**Q: How is this different from regular school science?**
A: Regular science often focuses on memorizing facts. Nobel Minds focuses on thinking like a scientist—asking questions, testing ideas, learning from results. The facts come naturally through discovery.

**Q: Will this help my child in exams?**
A: Yes! Students who understand HOW science works do better on exams than students who only memorize. Plus, the skills (questioning, persistence, analysis) help in all subjects.

| Show value | "Here's what YOUR child discovered" |
| Home visits | If possible, visit homes |
| Phone calls | Personal invitation to participate |
| Family events | Fun events at school to build comfort |

---

### Challenge: Not Enough Time

**Symptoms:**
- Science keeps getting skipped
- Only doing science occasionally
- Rushing through activities

**Causes:**
- Pressure to cover other content
- Science seen as "extra"
- Poor planning

**Solutions:**

| Strategy | How to Implement |
|----------|------------------|
| Integrate with other subjects | Science during math, language, etc. |
| Short daily science | 15 minutes is better than nothing |
| Scheduled time | Put science on calendar, protect it |
| Morning questions | Start day with one science question |
| Routine | Same time each day so it becomes habit |

---

## Behavior Challenges

### Challenge: Student Destroys Materials

**Solutions:**
1. Teach material use explicitly
2. Practice with less valuable items first
3. Assign materials manager role
4. Have student repair/replace when possible
5. Investigate: Why is this happening?

### Challenge: Student Dominates Group

**Solutions:**
1. Assign specific roles
2. "No one speaks twice until everyone speaks once"
3. Private conversation about sharing
4. Give leadership responsibilities elsewhere
5. Pair with confident student

### Challenge: Student Refuses to Participate

**Solutions:**
1. Don't force—observe what interests them
2. Offer alternative entry points
